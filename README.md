# My Portfolio

## This is my first personal project, which I assigned to myself :smile:.

My work is accessible [here](https://abra-sena.github.io/portfolio/).
I develop this website from scratch, and by myself. I started a Web devlopment course in June 2020 which will last for 10 month. This project is still under construction, because I am still learning new things everyday. I will work on it as I go until it becomes a website from a professional Web Devlopper.
